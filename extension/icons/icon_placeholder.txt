This is a placeholder file for the browser extension icons.

In a real implementation, you would need to create the following icon files:
- icon16.png (16x16 pixels)
- icon48.png (48x48 pixels)
- icon128.png (128x128 pixels)
- icon16_active.png (active state icon)
- icon48_active.png (active state icon)
- icon128_active.png (active state icon)

These icons should be designed with the FuturePreppers branding and color scheme.
